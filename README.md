# WhatsApp-challenge-
this is a challenge to mock the client-side of whatsapp web application , using Angular js which i am trying to learn for the first time :D 
this application consists of 2 views , contact list and chat-view , what i am trying to reach is to choose a contact from the contact list then the chat-view appears.

till now the application is not finished ... this is the last update you may check it out .
